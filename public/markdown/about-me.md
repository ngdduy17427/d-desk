I am **Duy Nguyen**, a husband, a father of one, I was born in
[Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City) where I lived most of my
life. I am a full-time Front-end Developer.

I like to play with my daughter and do housework with my wife in the morning on my free time. When
the night comes I like to practice and develop some libraries to expand my skillset.

In my journey, I've become well-versed in microservices design patterns, understanding how to create
scalable, maintainable, and decoupled architectures. I believe that clean code and elegant solutions
are essential for success in any development endeavor.
